# Introduction
The WaziAct is an all in one style development board for projects involving the great outdoor and sensing, unlike the WaziSense, it also has a relay for actuation. Fitted with a lora sx1276 chip, its able to communicate with a lora enabled gateway over long distances. It also has terminal connectors which make it easy to hookup peripherals and deploy solutions with ease.
