# Introduction
The wazisense is an all in one style development board for projects involving outdoor sensing and agricultural purposes. Fitted with a lora sx1276 chip, its able to communicate with a lora enabled gateway over long distances. It has supercaps that enable it to keep running for a few more hours in the event of power loss. It also has terminal connectors which make it easy to hookup peripherals and deploy outdoor solutions with ease.
