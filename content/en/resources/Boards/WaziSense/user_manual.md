6. Select the resource sketch example and make changes where required for the preferred use case.


## Uploading to the Right Board

The microcontroller on the WaziSense is a 3.3v 8MHz ATmega328p, as such, users need navigate to the “**Tools Menu**” and select “**Arduino Pro or Pro Mini**” under “**Board**:” and “**ATmega328p (3.3V, 8MHz)**” under “**Processor:**”.



![wazisense parameters](img/wazisenseparameters.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 13:_ Selecting the right board parameters for the WaziSense

**Note:** Make sure to select the correct “**Communication Port Number**” of your FTDI.


## Lora

To use the WaziSense v2 with lora, you first need to add all relevant Waziup resources to your arduino IDE as demonstrated in “**Section 4.1**” above.



1. Open your Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketchbook under the File Menu. Locate and open the **Actuation **sketch sample under LoRaWAN.



![actuator example](img/actuatorexample.png "image_tooltip")



_Figure 14:_ Locating Actuation sketch sample in Waziup resources



2. The Actuation sketch sample should look like the following.

```c
#include <WaziDev.h>
#include <xlpp.h>
#include <Base64.h>

// NwkSKey (Network Session Key) and Appkey (AppKey) are used for securing LoRaWAN transmissions.
// You need to copy them from/to your LoRaWAN server or gateway.
// You need to configure also the devAddr. DevAddr need to be different for each devices!!
// Copy'n'paste the DevAddr (Device Address): 26011D00
unsigned char devAddr[4] = {0x26, 0x01, 0x1D, 0x00};

// Copy'n'paste the key to your Wazigate: 23158D3BBC31E6AF670D195B5AED5525
unsigned char appSkey[16] = {0x23, 0x15, 0x8D, 0x3B, 0xBC, 0x31, 0xE6, 0xAF, 0x67, 0x0D, 0x19, 0x5B, 0x5A, 0xED, 0x55, 0x25};

// Copy'n'paste the key to your Wazigate: 23158D3BBC31E6AF670D195B5AED5525
unsigned char nwkSkey[16] = {0x23, 0x15, 0x8D, 0x3B, 0xBC, 0x31, 0xE6, 0xAF, 0x67, 0x0D, 0x19, 0x5B, 0x5A, 0xED, 0x55, 0x25};

WaziDev wazidev;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(38400);
  wazidev.setupLoRaWAN(devAddr, appSkey, nwkSkey);
}

XLPP xlpp(120);

void loop(void)
{
  // 1
  // Create xlpp payload.
  xlpp.reset();
  xlpp.addTemperature(1, 45.7); // °C

  // 2.
  // Send paload with LoRaWAN.
  serialPrintf("LoRaWAN send ... ");
  uint8_t e = wazidev.sendLoRaWAN(xlpp.buf, xlpp.len);
  if (e != 0)
  {
    serialPrintf("Err %d\n", e);
    delay(60000);
    return;
  }
  serialPrintf("OK\n");
  
  // 3.
  // Receive LoRaWAN message (waiting for 6 seconds only).
  serialPrintf("LoRa receive ... ");
  uint8_t offs = 0;
  long startSend = millis();
  e = wazidev.receiveLoRaWAN(xlpp.buf, &xlpp.offset, &xlpp.len, 6000);
  long endSend = millis();
  if (e != 0)
  {
    if (e == ERR_LORA_TIMEOUT){
      serialPrintf("nothing received\n");
    }
    else
    {
      serialPrintf("Err %d\n", e);
    }
    delay(60000);
    return;
  }
  serialPrintf("OK\n");
  
  serialPrintf("Time On Air: %d ms\n", endSend-startSend);
  serialPrintf("LoRa SNR: %d\n", wazidev.loRaSNR);
  serialPrintf("LoRa RSSI: %d\n", wazidev.loRaRSSI);
  serialPrintf("LoRaWAN frame size: %d\n", xlpp.offset+xlpp.len);
  serialPrintf("LoRaWAN payload len: %d\n", xlpp.len);
  serialPrintf("Payload: ");
  char payload[100];
  base64_decode(payload, xlpp.getBuffer(), xlpp.len); 
  serialPrintf(payload);
  serialPrintf("\n");
  
  delay(60000);
}
```


3. In the void loop section, there is a dummy temperature value of “**45.7**”. This value will be transmitted to the gateway. Replace this value with actual temperature sensor variables, if you have a sensor attached to the Wazisense. You will need to add the required sketch for your specific sensor to the provided lora sample sketch above. Also make sure to add the relevant libraries required for your specific sensor to your arduino IDE.




![dummy values](img/dummyvalues.png "image_tooltip")



_Figure 15:_ hard coded dummy temperature value in sketch sample



4. Take note of the device address, network and app session keys provided in the lora sketch sample. It will be needed later when binding the wazisense board to the gateway.


![device config parameters](img/deviceconfigparameters.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 16:_ Needed keys for device LoraWAN configuration.



5. At this point we need to set up this Wazisense board as a LoraWAN device on the gateway. See [here](https://lab.waziup.io/courses/waziup/waziup/wazigate) for instructions on what you need and how to set up a new gateway for the first time.

     
On your gateway dashboard, add a new device by clicking on the “**+**” sign at the lower right corner of the screen.




![creating sensor](img/creatingsensor.png "image_tooltip")



_Figure 17:_ Creating a new sensor device



6. Give your new sensor a name and click “**ok**”.



![naming device](img/namingdevice.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 18:_ Creating a device named “New_Test_Device”

Upon clicking “ok” a new sensor card is created on your dashboard.


![new device](img/newdevice.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 19:_ New device created



7. Click on the new device you just created to configure it. In the device interface, click on the three dotted menu



![three dots](img/threedots.png "image_tooltip")
 and select “Make LoRaWAN”.



![make lorawan](img/makelorawan.png "image_tooltip")



_Figure 20:_ Making device LoRaWAN



8. Copy and paste the device address, network and app session keys in LoRa sketch sample in the relevant spaces and Save the configurations as shown.



![making lorawan](img/makinglorawan.png "image_tooltip")

_Figure 21:_ Making device LoRaWAN

9. At this point, you can upload your lora sketch sample to your WaziSense board. You can also view device lora communication details via the arduino serial monitor. Make sure the serial monitor baud rate is **38400 **(to match the uploaded sketch example)




![serial monitor](img/serialmonitor.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 22:_ Lora communication in Serial Monitor


The Wazigate dashboard should also receive and indicate the dummy date transmitted accordingly.



![new configered device](img/newconfigereddevice.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 23:_ Wazigate dashboard showing received sensor value.


## Regulator and Input Voltage Configuration

The WaziSense v2 supports the use of different types of batteries at different voltages. For instance, two AA batteries in series will amount to 3v, and a lithium-ion/polymer battery will output about 4.2v when fully charged. 

To use voltages above 3.3v, one must set the input jumper to the **REG **position to allow the regulator to chop down the input voltage to 3.3v. 

With voltages below 3.3v such as that from two AA batteries in series, users can bypass the regulator by setting the input jumper to the **BATT **position. See below some illustrations of possible configurations.




![input voltage config](img/inputvoltageconfig.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 24:_ shows the 2 Input voltage configuration

**Note:** Leaving the input voltage jumper in the **BATT **position may damage your board, if a voltage sufficiently above 3.3v is applied.


## Battery Charging with Solar

The solar battery charging circuit supports input voltages between 5.2v to 28v and output 4.2v at 4A max. This means that the WaziSense can be used together with most readily available solar panels on the market and the rate of battery charging depends on the solar panel connected.

Users can isolate the solar circuit from the rest of the WaziSense board, in situations where the solar functionality isn't needed or used. This conserves a little more battery power.



![regargeable battery](img/regargeablebattery.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 25:_ how to connect a rechargeable battery and solar panel

**Note:** When using a solar panel, make sure the battery connected is rechargeable.


## Sensor Power Ports

In order to conserve battery energy, sensors can be digitally turned on or off using the sensor power port.

To attach a sensor to the power power port, connect the sensors +/VCC pin to the port labeled + on one of the sensor power terminal blocks. Connect the -/GND pin of the sensor to the port labeled - on the same sensor power terminal block as before.

Users must declare the mosfet control pin to be used, as an OUTPUT pin by pinMode(mosfetPin, OUTPUT);. After pin declaration, perform a digitalWrite(mosfetPin, HIGH);To turn a sensor ON and digitalWrite(mosfetPin, LOW); to turn sensors OFF as shown below




![mosfet pin](img/mosfetpin.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 16:_ how to declare mosfet pin



![mosfet pin power](img/mosfetpinpower.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 26:_ how to turn the power port D6 ON

**NOTE: **



1. **mosfetPin **is a variable for either digital pin** 6 **or **7**
2. Perform at least **2 seconds delay** after turning ON sensors. This will allow enough time for the sensors to be ready and respond to queries.



![sensor on power port](img/sensoronpowerport.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 27:_ how to connect a sensor to the power ports


### Output Voltage For Sensor Power Port 


    Occasionally users might want to connect sensors or peripherals that may draw high sudden currents during operation. The high sudden currents can be provided by the connected battery or power source directly by configuring the **H1** sensor power jumper. 
 
By setting the H1 jumper to the **BATT **position, sensors or peripherals attached to both sensor power terminal blocks will directly access the voltage of the battery or power source connected to the board. For sensors that need 3.3v volts, the H1 jumper can then be set to the **3.3v** position.


     
**NOTE:** make sure attached sensors or peripherals can handle the voltage supplied to the WaziSense when the H1 jumper is set to the **BATT **position.



![h1 jumper](img/h1jumper.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 28:_ how to configure H1 jumper for sensors or peripherals


## Analog and Digital Sensor Ports


### Using Digital Sensors

To use a digital sensor such as a DH11 with the WaziSense v2:



1. First connect your sensor's power pin to a sensor power port.
2. Then connect the signal output of the sensor to a digital pin of your choice.

    


![dht on power port](img/dhtonpowerport.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 29:_ DH11 in use on digital pin 4 and power port D6

3. Connect an FTDI programmer to the FTDI port of the WaziSense v2. See “section 7.2” under “Peripheral Interfaces” of this documentation to learn about using an FTDI
4. Open the sketch for the sensor in question and make the necessary sketch modifications to match the pin used(there are some sample sketches for sensors in the Waziup Resources)




![dht11 sketch](img/dht11sketch.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 30:_ Loading up DH11 sketch from Waziup Resources

5. Add the needed commands for turning ON the Sensor Power Port in use as specified under section “**4.6 Sensor Power Ports**”
6. Install the needed libraries for the sensor in question. In this case, the DHT11 by using the Arduino “**Libraries Manager**”.

    


![libraries manager](img/librariesmanager.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 31:_ Loading up the Arduino Libraries Manager




![dht11 installed](img/dht11installed.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 32:_ Searching for and Installing the DHT11 library by Adafruit

7. Make sure the correct target board is selected as specified under section “4.2 Uploading to the Right Board“ of this documentation.
8. Finally, upload your sketch to the WaziSense.

    The final code for the DHT11 connection in figure 20 above should look like this.


 ```c
#include "DHT.h"

DHT dht(4, DHT11);
int mosfetPin = 6;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  pinMode(mosfetPin, OUTPUT);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(mosfetPin, HIGH);
  delay(2000);

  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Wait a few seconds between measurements.
  delay(2000);

  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  
  // Check if any reads failed and exit early (to try again).
  if (isnan(h) || isnan(t)) {
    Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
    return;
  }

  Serial.print("Hum: ");
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print("%  Temp: ");
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.println("°C ");
}
```



    After uploading the above sketch, the serial monitor should begin to display temperature and humidity sensor data at a 2 seconds interval.




![sensor data in serial monitor](img/sensordatainserialmonitor.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 33:_ Serial monitor showing DHT11 sensor data



### Using Analog Sensors


    To use an analog sensor such as a soil moisture sensor with the WaziSense v2



1. First connect your sensor's power pin to a sensor power port.
2. Then connect the signal output of the sensor to an analog pin of your choice.

    


![soil moisture](img/soilmoisture.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 34:_ DH11 in use on digital pin 4 and power port D6

3. Connect an FTDI programmer to the FTDI port of the WaziSense v2. See “section 7.2” under “Peripheral Interfaces” of this documentation to learn about using an FTDI
4. Open the sketch for the sensor in question and make the necessary sketch modifications to match the pin used(there are some sample sketches for sensors in the Waziup Resources)

    


![soil moisture sketch](img/soilmoisturesketch.png "image_tooltip")



    _Figure 35:_ Loading up Soil Moisture sketch from Waziup Resources

5. Add the needed commands for turning ON the Sensor Power Port in use as specified under section “**4.6 Sensor Power Ports**”.
6. Make sure the correct target board is selected as specified under section “**4.2 Uploading to the Right Board**“ of this documentation.
7. Finally, upload your sketch to the WaziSense.

    The final code for the Analog Sensor connection in figure 25 above should look like this.


```c
/********************
 * Soil humidity sensor tester
 * Read soil humidity by measuring its resistance.
 ********************/

int sensorPin = A2;
const int mosfetPin = 6;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  
  pinMode(mosfetPin, OUTPUT);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(mosfetPin, HIGH);
  delay(2000);
}

void loop() {
  float soilHumidity = analogRead(sensorPin);
  
  //The Higher the analog reading, the less water.
  //1023 for DRY
  //0 for So Much Water

  Serial.println(soilHumidity);
  delay(1000);
}
```


    After uploading the above sketch, the serial monitor should begin to display soil moisture data at 1 second intervals.

## Onboard LED

The OnBoard LED is attached to digital pin 8. As such it can triggered by using any generic blink sketch as shown below;


```c
const int onboardLED = 8;

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(onboardLED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(onboardLED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(onboardLED, LOW);    // turn the LED off 
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
```



![blinking onboard led](img/blinkingonboardled.gif "image_tooltip")

The sketch should look like this.


```c
////////////////////////////////////////////////
//This code was inspired by:
//https://github.com/Yveaux/Arduino_Vcc
//I made a few modifications to read out the voltage of batteries attached to the arduino.
//The positive terminal of the battery should be connected to Analog pin A0 through a voltage divider(both R1 & R2 are 10k ohms each)
//NOTE: 1. Always make sure both R1 & R2 resistors have the same ohm values(even if you use resistor values of your choice)
//      2. Add the Vcc.h and Vcc.cpp files to your Arduino libraries folder before uploading
//visit https://www.youtube.com/delali to learn more about electronics and building smart things from scratch
////////////////////////////////////////////////

#include <Vcc.h>

//MORE DECIMAL PLACES LEAD TO MUCH ACCURATE BATTERY READING(thus for VccMax and VccCorrection)
const float VccMin   = 0.0;           // Minimum expected Vcc level, in Volts.

# Peripheral Interfaces


## I2C Port

The I2C SDA and SCL terminal block is wired to the pins A4 and A5 of the Atmega328p respectively. 




![i2c port](img/i2cport.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 45:_ I2C Port pinout on WaziSense

**NOTE:** The SDA and SCL ports can be used as regular analog pins. That is A4 and A5 as shown in figure 29 above.


## FTDI Port

The FTDI port is used to program the ATmega328p microcontroller. It is advised to use an **FT232RL **FTDI programmer because its pins are already aligned with the WaziSense v2 FTDI port.

**NOTE: **Make sure to set the FTDI modules’ voltage output to 3.3v, using the provided jumper on the FTDI board. The ATmega328p on the WaziSense v2 is **NOT **5v tolerant.

_Figure 46:_ how to connect an FTDI to the WaziSense

**Alternately**, If users don't have an FT232RL FTDI programmer, they can still use any other TTL to USB programmer. The wiring should be connected as shown below:

## SPI Port

The WaziSense v2 SPI layout is similar to what is found on many development boards, including the arduino uno, mega etc.. Therefore the WaziSense v2 SPI header is compatible with existing modules in the arduino ecosystem.




![spi port](img/spiport.png "image_tooltip")


_Figure 48:_ Wazisense SPI header layout

The onboard LoRa RFM95W communicates with the ATmega328p over SPI, therefore users who wish to use SPI port with the ATmega328p chip, need to remove the lead/solder material bridging each pair of pads to open the MI_J, MO_J and SCK_J jumpers connections located on the back of the WaziSense v2.

## IPEX Antenna Port

To use the WaziSense for Lora communication, there is a need to connect an antenna. A **Female UFL to Female SMA** connector and** **an **antenna with a Male SMA** connector is needed. The aforementioned parts need to be connected to the Wazisense as shown below.

## Prototyping Area

The prototyping area on the WaziSense v2 serves as a simple way to add extra components such as resistors, diodes etc.. to the WaziSense v2 board during prototyping/testing/deployment.

All the **square-shaped** holes are connected to ground. However every other hole in the prototyping area isn't connected to anything. The user decides what to connect the holes to or how to use them.
