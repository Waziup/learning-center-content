# Introduction

Resistors are passive electronic components that impede the flow of electric current. They are fundamental components in electronic circuits, used to control the amount of current flowing through a circuit, adjust signal levels, terminate transmission lines, and much more. Resistors come in various types, each with unique characteristics suited for specific applications.



# Applications 

Resistors find applications in a wide range of electronic circuits and devices, including but not limited to:

- Voltage dividers
- Current limiting
- Pull-up and pull-down resistors
- Filtering and smoothing circuits
- Signal conditioning
- Oscillator circuits
- Temperature sensing circuits
- LED current limiting
- Audio circuits
- Power supplies
- RF circuits
