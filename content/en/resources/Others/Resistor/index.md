Resistors are passive electronic components that impede the flow of electric current. They are fundamental components in electronic circuits, used to control the amount of current flowing through a circuit, adjust signal levels, terminate transmission lines, and much more. Resistors come in various types, each with unique characteristics suited for specific applications.
