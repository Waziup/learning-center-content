# Introduction

An IPX to SMA cable is used to connect internal mini coaxial RF connectors (IPX) to external larger SMA connectors, allowing the use of external antennas with IoT devices like the ESP32.

# Key Features:
- IPX (U.FL) connector on one end for internal use, and SMA connector on the other for external antennas.
- Used to improve Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signal strength in IoT devices.

# Applications:
Extending the range of wireless communication for IoT devices, particularly in scenarios where internal antennas are inadequate.
