# Introduction

As the name suggest, the wazihat sits on top of the raspberry pi to enable it to communicate with sensor nodes and actuators via LoRa. The wazihat pro single is fitted with a 0.96" OLED and an SX1276 chip. Beyond the waziup edge operating system of the raspberry pi, the wazihat is essentially the reason the raspberry pi can serve as a LoRa gateway.
