# Introduction
A Potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with an adjustable center tap. In IoT labs, it's often used to simulate analog inputs such as varying sensor values.

# Key Features:
- Variable resistor that can adjust resistance from zero to a maximum value.
- Outputs analog signals that can be read by a microcontroller with ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) capabilities.

# Applications:
Used to control input parameters such as brightness, volume, or speed in IoT projects.
