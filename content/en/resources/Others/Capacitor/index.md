# Introduction

Capacitors are passive electronic components that store electrical energy in an electric field. They consist of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called the dielectric. Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for various purposes, including energy storage, signal filtering, voltage regulation, and timing.
