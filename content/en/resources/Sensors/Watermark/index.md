# Introduction
In use since 1978, the patented WATERMARK sensor is a solid-state electrical resistance sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension. As the tension changes with water content the resistance changes as well. That resistance can be measured using the WATERMARK Sensor. 

The sensor consists of a pair of highly corrosion resistant electrodes that are imbedded within a granular matrix. A current is applied to the WATERMARK to obtain a resistance value. The WATERMARK Meter or Monitor correlates the resistance to centibars (cb) or kilopascals (kPa) of soil water tension. 

The WATERMARK is designed to be a permanent sensor, placed in the soil to be monitored and “read” as often as necessary with a portable or stationary device. Internally installed gypsum provides some buffering for the effect of salinity levels normally found in irrigated agricultural crops and landscapes.

## How does it work?
    From Kirchoff’s Law we know that voltage measured over two resistors connected in series, divide according to their respective resistance values. In our sensor interface we have one known resistor (1500Ω), and one unknown resistor value (this is our gypsum sensor).

    By measuring the voltages over the known and the unknown resistor, using the analog inputs of the Arduino board, we can calculate the sensor resistance value.
