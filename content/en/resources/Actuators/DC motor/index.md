# Introduction

![alt text](img/Motor_intro.png)

There are several types of motor availables according to the rate of voltage at which the motor operates. For instance, let's consider the 12V DC motor.

A 12V DC motor is a widely used electric motor that operates on a 12-volt direct current (DC) power supply. These motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy through the interaction of magnetic fields and conductors, providing rotational motion. Due to their versatility, reliability, and relatively simple control mechanisms, 12V DC motors are prevalent in a wide range of applications from household appliances to automotive systems and robotics.
