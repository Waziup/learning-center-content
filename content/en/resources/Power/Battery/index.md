# Introduction

An 18650 battery is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The "18650" identification refers to the battery's dimensions: 18mm in diameter and 65mm in length. 18650 batteries are widely used in electronic equipment including laptop computers and flashlights, as well as electric cars and other high-power applications. Their extended lifespan, high energy density, and comparatively low self-discharge rate are well-known characteristics.

Some 18650s have been modified with a button top and/or inbuilt protection circuit. An "18650" battery's physical length may grow as a result, from 65 to 70 mm, or maybe longer in some circumstances.  When utilizing an 18650 battery in a consumer product, you should always confirm the precise parameters needed to power the device with the manufacturer.
