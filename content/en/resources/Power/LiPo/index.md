# Introduction

These batteries are lightweight and quite practical to use!

1. Economical and safe: A PCM protection board guards against short circuits, overdischarges, and other hazards in every battery. Li-Polymer batteries are memory-free and harmless to the environment, as they are not damaging the natural world.
2. Outstanding features of discharge: Possess a larger range of applications due to their low internal resistance and high, flat voltage characteristics during intense current discharge.
3. Long cycle life: It has an extended shelf life with minimal restrictions. After extended storage, it provides trouble-free charging, enabling usage in a variety of applications.
