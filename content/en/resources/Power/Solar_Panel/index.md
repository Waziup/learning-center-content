# Introduction

Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into electricity or heat.

A solar panel is essentially an array of solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, that are capable of producing energy through the photovoltaic effect. On the surface of solar panels, these cells are organized in a grid-like configuration.As a result, it might alternatively be thought of as a collection of solar modules installed on a framework. A solar cell assembly of 6x10 is packaged and joined to form a photovoltaic (PV) module.These panels have a very high wear-and-tear tolerance. Solar panels deteriorate very slowly. Their efficacy drops by only one to two percent (often even less) in a year.Crystalline silicon solar cells are used to make the majority of solar panels.


# Types of Solar Panel

The three main types of solar panels are monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film.

- **Monocrystalline** solar panels are the most efficient.

- **Polycrystalline** solar panels can be the most cost-effective.

- **Thin-film** solar panels can be the best for DIY projects or RVs
