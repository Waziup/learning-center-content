The Program foresees 2 interactive online workshops on investor readiness, covering topics such as: Fundraising Planning, Fundraising Material Preparation, The Fundraising Process, The Human Element, What to Look for in an Investor and Startup Valuation.

In month 3, African Innovation Weeks and Investor Pitches will be held for African entrepreneurs to present their ideas and seek funding, creating opportunities and the possibility of partnerships.

In addition, counseling will be provided on accessing private funding (ESN involving their network) and public funding (INSOMNIA).

African Hubs will provide the startups an opportunity to interact with potential investors face to face in an investor fair session. They will have an opportunity to pitch directly to these investors and be evaluated for qualification for funding.Â
