In this Phase of the program, you will discover the importance of crafting a go-to-market strategy to ready yourself for the launch of your product.

A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is an extensive plan employed by businesses to introduce a new product or service to the market. Developed to reduce the inherent risks of launching a new product, a standard GTM strategy encompasses target market profiles, a marketing plan, and a well-defined sales and distribution strategy.

# GMT Strategy: Purpose

Recognizing the challenges in entering competitive markets, these strategies involve identifying target markets, articulating value propositions, creating marketing plans, and formulating effective sales and distribution channels.

Some of the most common benefits of compiling an effective GTM strategy include:
