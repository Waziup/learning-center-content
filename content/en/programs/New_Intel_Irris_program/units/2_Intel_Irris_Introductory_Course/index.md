In this part of the program, participants will delve into various IoT courses and Agricultural courses to gain some basic knowldge and understandings about the upcoming tasks.




# AGRI courses

The AGRI courses focus on the agriculture part and will mainly present the complex soil-water-plant-atmosphere interactions, some specific soil sensor technologies and constraints and some examples of sensor deployment in fields

A number of tutorial resources will explain some agriculture knowledge useful to understand INTEL-IRRIS irrigation objectives. Many of those tutorials are selected from third-party presenters.

In the first video in this series, Nebraska Extension Educator Steve Melvin covers some basic terms and concepts of crop water needs and irrigation scheduling, including how soil holds water, soil water-plant interactions, and how much water can be saved through scheduling.

This video demonstrates two common techniques: Irrigation Scheduling Using Management Zones and Irrigation Scheduling Using Percent of Plant Available Water, looking at how they work and advantages and disadvantages of each.

Advanced Irrigation Scheduling Techniques demonstrates additional options, including how to estimate inches of available water in the root zone, determine how much irrigation would be needed to refill to field capacity, and estimate how many days it will be until the crop needs water. Another advanced strategy is creating and maintaining a dryer zone at the 12- to 24-inch depth. The strategy can assure minimal deep percolation and create a place to store rain, but does not require any math. These charts and additional information are available in Irrigation Scheduling Strategies When Using Soil Water Data (EC3036), a Nebraska Extension publication.

# IOT Courses


The IT/IOT courses focus on the technological part and will mainly present Internet-of-Thing (IoT), remote sensing, basic electronics, microcontrollers and Arduino programming. 

A number of tutorial resources will explain some technology concepts behind the INTEL-IRRIS smart irrigation platform. Many of those tutorials are selected from third-party presenters. They are organized sequentially below.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolution of mobile, home, and embedded devices that are connected to the internet, integrating computing capabilities and using data analytics to extract valuable information. Soon, hundreds of billions of devices will be connected to the Internet. Connected devices become intelligent systems of systems, sharing data over the cloud and transforming our businesses, lives, and world in countless ways. Intel processors are designed to help you get to market faster and allow users to scale solutions across a variety of platforms. Watch the following video by Intel to learn more.
