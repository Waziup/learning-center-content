In this part of the program, participants will delve into various IoT courses and Agricultural courses to gain some basic knowldge and understandings about the upcoming tasks.

# IOT Courses


The IT/IOT courses focus on the technological part and will mainly present Internet-of-Thing (IoT), remote sensing, basic electronics, microcontrollers and Arduino programming. 

A number of tutorial resources will explain some technology concepts behind the INTEL-IRRIS smart irrigation platform. Many of those tutorials are selected from third-party presenters. They are organized sequentially below.

# AGRI courses

The AGRI courses focus on the agriculture part and will mainly present the complex soil-water-plant-atmosphere interactions, some specific soil sensor technologies and constraints and some examples of sensor deployment in fields

A number of tutorial resources will explain some agriculture knowledge useful to understand INTEL-IRRIS irrigation objectives. Many of those tutorials are selected from third-party presenters.
