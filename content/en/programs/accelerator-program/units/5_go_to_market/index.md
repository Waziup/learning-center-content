In this Phase of the program, you will discover the importance of crafting a go-to-market strategy to ready yourself for the launch of your product.

A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is an extensive plan employed by businesses to introduce a new product or service to the market. Developed to reduce the inherent risks of launching a new product, a standard GTM strategy encompasses target market profiles, a marketing plan, and a well-defined sales and distribution strategy.
