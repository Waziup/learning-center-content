As your IoT prototype get more and more advanced, you need to worry about the data and algorithms at its core.
This unit will cover the basics of data analysis, data visualisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

This unit covers the following topics:
- The fundamentals of AI
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Data Visualizations
- IoT data analysis

The first course will give you the fundamentals of AI. We then covers two of the main fields of AI: Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
The last two courses are more oriented to data analysis than pure AI: data visualization is extremely important to extract insight from you data.
The last course gives you insight in data analysis for IoT in particular.
