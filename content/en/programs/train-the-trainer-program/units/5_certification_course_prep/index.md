Each engaged hub will run a 1-2 months IoT program, with an open call and select the persons for an IoT training and one bootcamp.

The hubs will need to propose two IoT based Minimal Viable Products(MVPs) based on local/ecosystem needs, and developed using the Solution Box (a complete IoT hardware and software infrastructure). The tech expert at the hub will develop the MVP for their network partner and create the related business model. Alternatively, they can name startups from their network and assist them to develop the 2 MVPs.
