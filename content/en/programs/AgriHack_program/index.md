# Overview

RETO-DOSSO project aims to demonstrate that a solar system improves water, electricity, and food supply in rural areas, strengthens the rural economy, and is a worthwhile business model for local investors. The project intends to install a pilot solar system at a village school in Niger’s Dosso region to power a groundwater pump with drinking water treatment, support irrigation, and provide electricity to operate village businesses.

The future of agriculture in Africa depends on convincing the continent's talented young people to take up careers in the agricultural sector. Due to the lack of access to training and technology, many young people see agriculture as a dead end and prefer to seek employment in urban areas. The outcome and experience will further strengthen the sustainability of such solutions in the participating countries as well as in the region as a whole.
