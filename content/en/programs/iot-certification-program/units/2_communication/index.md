In this part of the program, participants will delve into the fundamentals of electronic devices, microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. The unit provides an insightful exploration of communication protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, and delves into wireless communication, featuring WiFi, Bluetooth, and LoRaWAN. This comprehensive course equips participants with essential knowledge to understand the intricacies of hardware components and communication technologies.

## Sensors

To complete a full IoT prototype, you also need to know about communications. Let's start with basic communications between sensors & boards: [Wiring and programming sensors](/courses/aOJfma3yr1Q). 

**You need to click on the "Start Now" button in the courses below, so that the course is added to your courses.**

<alert type='success'><b>Task 1:</b> Answer the questions in the questionaire at the end of the course.</alert>

PS. You can skip this one if you are already familiar with IoT!


## Radio communications and networking

To complete a full IoT prototype, you also need to know about long range communications.
We will cover the following course:
- Wireless communication essentials
- Wifi radio communications
- LoRa radio communications

<alert type='success'><b>Task 4:</b> Please do the Wifi exercice, and the LoRa exercice. Take a photo of your prototype and upload it to the Drive folder.</alert>
Don't forget to click "Mark topic done" when you have finished.
