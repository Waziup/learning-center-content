You should find all the components in your Solution Box. **TODO: describe Solution Box and give a link to the corresponding page.**

<alert type='success'><b>Task 1:</b> Add all the components from the Solution Box in the "My Lab" section.</alert>

## The WaziDev series

WaziDev, WaziSense and WaziAct are Sensing and Actuation development board for IoT applications. They transmits data up to 7Km using LoRaWAN. It is easily programmable and customizable, using Arduino technology.

Please go through the course on **WaziDev board series** below.

You can also find the documentation for the boards in the Lab.

<alert type='success'><b>Task 2:</b> Install the WaziDev and WaziSense. Go through all the instruction in [WaziDev](https://lab.waziup.io/resources/waziup/wazidev), and realize the "Blink a LED" and "Temperature and humidity sensor" exercices.</alert>


When done, please take a picture and upload it in the Drive folder.


## The WaziGate

WaziGate is an IoT LoRaWAN Gateway, ideal for all your remote IoT applications. The Gateway can cover up to 100 IoT Sensors and actuator nodes.

Please go through the course on **WaziGate** course, and also the [WaziGate documentation](https://lab.waziup.io/resources/waziup/wazigate) in the Lab.

<alert type='success'><b>Task 3:</b> You need to install your WaziGate. Please follow the video courses, and also the WaziGate documentation in the Lab.
Please take a photo of your installed WaziGate!</alert>

## The WaziCloud

Please follow the **WaziCloud** course and execute all the steps.

<alert type='success'><b>Task 4:</b> Make sure that your WaziGate is connected to your WaziCloud account. Please take a photo of your Cloud dashboard and upload it.</alert>

Optionally, you can follow the WaziCloud API course.

## End to end application

When you have done all the courses, you should be able to build your first end-to-end prototype with Waziup!

<alert type='success'><b>Task 5:</b> Measure a temperature using the DHT11 sensor, and send it to the WaziCloud dashboard. Please take a photo and upload it.</alert>
