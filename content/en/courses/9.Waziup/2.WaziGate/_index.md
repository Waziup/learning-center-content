WaziGate Overview
================

<!-- Let's start this lesson on the WaziGate with a tour of its parts and features. -->


WaziGate is an IoT LoRa Gateway, ideal for all your remote IoT applications. The Gateway can cover up to 100 IoT sensors and actuator nodes using the LoRa radio network: weather stations, soil monitoring, GPS applications, etc. The possibilities are endless! The Gateway can also control your actuators, such as electro-valves. You can host your own applications directly on the gateway and connect to it through WiFi. The gateway can easily work without Internet connectivity and still provide data to end-users through its embedded database and web-based visualization module.

Configuring Internet
====================
Let's now configure the internet on your WaziGate by following two steps:

**Step #1:** Select the menu Settings/Wifi.

Once Wazigate finds all the available WiFi networks in range, click on the network that you want to connect to.

**Step #2:** Enter the password for that network and click on "connect."

<alert type='warning'> Once you set up your WaziGate to connect to a WiFi network, you will lose the hotspot connection.</alert>

Configuring the Gateway
======================


Let's now configure the rest of your WaziGate according to the video tutorial.

A Waziup account enables you to receive all your sensor data in your dashboard and manage your Wazigate remotely. If you do not have an account on the [Waziup dashboard](https://login.waziup.io/auth/realms/waziup/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=dashboard&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.waziup.io%2F&state=7c9547dd-c0bf-4b2a-8642-bdc13a3949a3&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=1a520f4b-4814-4607-8472-aaeba34f5b6b), you need to create one first. Then follow the steps:

**Step #1:** Click on the Sync menu. 

**Step #2:** Enter your cloud username and password, and click Save.

**Step #3:** Flip the Active Sync ON.

<alert type='warning'> You need to enter your CLOUD login or password, collected on https://dashboard.waziup.io/. Do not enter your gateway password here.</alert>
