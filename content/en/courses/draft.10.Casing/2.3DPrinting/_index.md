# 3D printing and assembly

3D printing can be used to create the casing for your prototype. In this course, you will learn how to use 3D softwares in order to create a perfect box for your solution.

## Introduction

At its core, 3D printing involves layer-by-layer additive manufacturing. A digital model is sliced into layers, and the printer builds the object layer by layer, fusing materials together to create the final product. This stands in contrast to traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, such as milling or carving, where material is removed to create the desired shape.

## Basics of 3D printing

### Understanding the 3D Printing Process

**Layer-by-Layer Additive Manufacturing:**

At its core, 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process where objects are built layer by layer. This contrasts with subtractive manufacturing methods, which involve cutting or milling material to achieve the desired shape. In 3D printing, a digital model is sliced into thin layers, and the printer deposits or solidifies material one layer at a time, gradually forming the final three-dimensional object.

**The Importance of Digital Modeling:**

Before 3D printing, a digital model of the object is created using computer-aided design (CAD) software. This digital file serves as the blueprint for the physical object and dictates the printer's movements during the printing process.

### Common 3D Printing Processes:

- **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM):**

  Thermoplastic filaments are heated and extruded layer by layer to create the object.

- **Stereolithography (SLA):**

  Liquid resin is cured layer by layer using ultraviolet light to produce high-resolution, detailed prints.

- **Selective Laser Sintering (SLS):**

  Fine powder is selectively fused together by a laser, creating strong and intricate structures.

- **Digital Light Processing (DLP):**

  Similar to SLA but uses a digital light projector to cure entire layers simultaneously.

### Types of 3D printers

**Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM):**

  Most common and affordable, suitable for a wide range of applications.

**Stereolithography (SLA):**

  Offers high precision and smooth surface finishes, commonly used for detailed prototypes.

**Selective Laser Sintering (SLS):**

  Utilizes lasers to fuse powdered materials, enabling the printing of complex and functional parts.

**Digital Light Processing (DLP):**

  Similar to SLA but employs a digital light projector for curing layers.

## Design file formats

**STL (Standard Tessellation Language)**

  The STL file format is a widely used file format in 3D printing. It represents 3D geometry as a collection of triangular facets, defining the surface of the object. STL files use a mesh structure to approximate the surface of a 3D model, breaking it down into a series of connected triangles.
  STL files come in two formats - binary (compressed, smaller file size) and ASCII (human-readable but larger file size).

**OBJ (Wavefront OBJ)**

  _Description:_ Developed by Wavefront Technologies, OBJ files support both geometry and material properties.

  _Applications:_ Commonly used for 3D graphics and is compatible with 3D modeling software.

**AMF (Additive Manufacturing File Format)**

  _Description:_ A more advanced file format than STL, AMF supports color, materials, and more detailed geometry.

  _Applications:_ Suitable for complex designs with intricate features and color information.

**3MF (3D Manufacturing Format)**

  _Description:_ Developed by the 3MF Consortium, 3MF is an XML-based file format supporting color, materials, and more.

  _Applications:_ A modern format aimed at addressing some limitations of STL, offering enhanced capabilities for multi-material and multi-color printing.

**STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data)**

  _Description:_ A CAD file format that represents 3D objects using parametric information.

  _Applications:_ Widely used in the manufacturing industry for exchanging information between different CAD systems.

### Slicers

  A slicer is a crucial piece of software in the 3D printing process that takes a 3D model, typically in STL format, and converts it into a series of instructions (G-code) that the 3D printer understands.

**Key Functions**

  - The slicer breaks down the 3D model into horizontal layers, determining how each layer will be printed.
  - It calculates the toolpath for the 3D printer's nozzle or laser, outlining the route it should follow for each layer.
  - Some slicers can automatically generate support structures for overhanging parts of the model.

**Role of Slicers in 3D Printing**

  The slicer translates the 3D model into a language the 3D printer understands â€“ G-code. G-code consists of specific instructions for movements, temperatures, and other parameters.

    - Users can specify the thickness of each printed layer, affecting the level of detail and printing speed.
    - Slicers allow users to control the amount of infill (internal structure) within the printed object, balancing strength and material usage.
    - Users can adjust the speed at which the printer moves, influencing the overall print time and quality.

  Slicers analyze the 3D model and can automatically generate support structures to ensure that overhanging or bridging sections of the object print successfully.
  These supports are designed to be easily removable after the print is complete.

    - Slicers provide a visual representation of how each layer will be printed, allowing users to identify potential issues before printing.
    - Users can also estimate the time it will take to print a model and the amount of material required.

### Preparing the 3D Printer

1. Calibration and Leveling of the Print Bed
   It ensures an even and consistent first layer, crucial for successful prints. It prevents issues like adhesion problems, warping, and uneven surfaces.

  **Steps for Bed Calibration:**

  - **Home the Printer:** Use the printer's interface to move the print head to the home position.
  - **Disable Steppers:** Disable the stepper motors to manually move the print head and adjust the bed.
  - **Leveling Screws:** Adjust the leveling screws at each corner of the bed until a sheet of paper can be moved with slight resistance between the nozzle and bed.
  - **Repeat:** Recheck and adjust as needed, ensuring the entire bed is uniformly leveled.

2. Checking and Calibrating the Extruder

  Ensures accurate filament extrusion, preventing under or over-extrusion issues.
  Maintains consistent layer adhesion and print quality.

  **Steps for Extruder Calibration:**

  - **Mark Filament:** Mark a point on the filament, a known distance (e.g., 100mm) from the extruder.
  - **Extrude Filament:** Use the printer interface to command the extruder to feed a specified length of filament.
  - **Measure:** Measure the distance between the mark and the extruder after extrusion.
  - **Calculate and Adjust:** If the actual extruded length differs from the commanded length, calculate the correction factor and adjust the extruder steps per millimeter in the firmware.

3. Temperature Settings and Considerations

  **Hotend Temperature:**

  PLA: Typically printed between 190Â°C to 220Â°C.
  ABS: Requires higher temperatures, usually between 230Â°C to 260Â°C.
  PETG: Printed at temperatures ranging from 220Â°C to 250Â°C.

  **Bed Temperature:**

  PLA: Often does not require a heated bed but benefits from temperatures around 50Â°C.
  ABS: Heated bed temperatures between 80Â°C to 100Â°C.
  PETG: A heated bed around 75Â°C to 85Â°C is recommended.

### Post-Printing Procedures

Always ensures the integrity of the printed object.
Minimizes the risk of damaging the build plate or the print.

**Steps for Safe Removal:**

- **Cooling:** Allow the print and build plate to cool down to room temperature.
- **Use a Spatula or Scraper:** Gently slide a spatula or scraper underneath the print, starting from the edges.
- **Apply Pressure:** If necessary, apply slight pressure to encourage separation between the print and the build plate.
- **Avoid Force:** Avoid excessive force to prevent damage to the build plate or the printed object.

**Understanding Support Structures**
Support structures are temporary elements generated during the 3D printing process to provide stability for overhanging or bridging sections of a print.
They prevent sagging, deformation, and other issues that can arise when printing complex geometries.

**Tools and Techniques for Removing Supports**

1. Pliers or Tweezers:
   Application: Removing large support structures.
   Technique: Grasp the support structure close to the model and gently wiggle or twist to break it away.

2. Flush Cutters or Side Cutters:
   Application: Trimming excess support material close to the model.
   Technique: Carefully cut away the supports, ensuring not to damage the model.

3. Needle Nose Pliers:
   Application: Useful for reaching into small and intricate areas.
   Technique: Carefully grab and pull away supports in tight spaces.

4. Heat Gun or Hot Air Gun:
   Application: Softening supports for easier removal.
   Technique: Apply heat to the support structures, making them more flexible and easier to peel away.

**Cleaning and Finishing Techniques**

1. Removing Support Structures:
   Use pliers, wire cutters, or specialized support removal tools.
   Sanding or filing can be employed for a smoother finish.

2. Smoothing Layer Lines:
