# Introduction to IoT

<!-- The first course will touch on the fundamentals of IoT. After a short history of the creation of IoT, the course will explain briefly what IoT is and why it is important.
It will also show some of its application use cases and domains. -->
The last decade has witnessed a surge in attention towards the Internet of Things (IoT), a paradigm that involves the connection of physical objects to the internet. These objects, encompassing machinery, automobiles, structures, and various items, collectively form the Internet of Things, equipped with firmware, internet connectivity, and sensor technologies.

This era marks a transformative shift, enabling machines to communicate not only with people but also with each other, courtesy of the IoT concept. The application of IoT technology extends to diverse domains such as smart homes, smart cities, industrial machinery, and wearable technologies.

Industries are experiencing a profound impact from the increasing integration of IoT. Reshaping sectors like manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and healthcare, the IoT is ushering in unprecedented changes. Its influence on the future is undeniable, promising significant transformations.

## History of IoT
The emergence of the first devices with internet connectivity in the early 1980s marked the beginning of the Internet of Things. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth's invention made it possible for devices to connect wirelessly (without any cable connections). IoT's first stages were mostly RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. RFID makes it possible to monitor and identify anything via radio waves. RFID tags were fixed to items, and they could be scanned to get data and find out where they were.
Kevin Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization, wanted to attract senior management’s attention to this exciting new technology. Because the internet was the hottest new trend in 1999, he called his presentation "The Internet of Things”.

## Types of IoT Devices
The Internet of Things is an extension of the internet we already know and use, further into our physical world. This is achieved by the use of sensors, actuators, and effectors. These devices are a subset of connected devices that are designed to collect and exchange data with minimal human intervention for various applications.

IoT devices can generally be grouped into 3 categories: namely- **Consumer IoT, Enterprise IoT**, and **Industrial IoT**

![image](img/iot-device-type.png)


**Consumer IoT** devices are physical personal devices like wearables and home appliances that gather data and then use that data to provide insights or take automated action.

**Enterprise IoT** devices refer to the use of physical 'things’, thus IoT devices in business processes for reducing manual work and increasing overall business efficiency. A typical example will be the use of IoT devices in logistics and the automatic tracking and logging of the whereabouts of shipments.

**Industrial IoT** refers to interconnected sensors, instruments, and other devices networked together with computers for industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management.

Challenges Facing IoT
======

- ### Security
    The interconnected nature of these devices creates a vast attack surface, making them susceptible to cyber threats. Issues such as insufficient encryption, weak authentication, and the sheer volume of devices make safeguarding IoT networks complex, requiring robust security measures to protect against potential breaches and unauthorized access.

- ### Regulations – Lack of Strong Regulations
    Without stringent guidelines, the industry faces issues related to privacy, data protection, and standardization. This lack of oversight can lead to inconsistent security practices, making it difficult to address potential risks and vulnerabilities effectively. Establishing clear and comprehensive regulations is crucial for ensuring the responsible development and deployment of IoT technologies.

- ### Availability of skilled Talent
    As the demand for professionals with expertise in areas such as cybersecurity, data analytics, and IoT architecture increases, a shortage of qualified individuals hinders the seamless development and maintenance of IoT systems.

IoT Architecture
================

There is no single consensus on an architecture for IoT that is agreed upon universally. However, different architectures have been proposed by different researchers. The 3 and 5 layer architectures are the most widely used. However, the third layer is the most commonly used. So in this lecture, we will look at the 3-layer architecture. The three first layers are: 
- *The perception layer* has sensors for sensing and gathering information about the environment.
- *The transport layer* allows devices to connect to smart things, network devices, and servers. It also transmits and processes sensor data.
- *The application layer* delivers application-specific services to the user. It defines various applications in which the Internet of Things can be deployed.

Additionally, we sometimes add two more layers:
- *The business layer* manages the whole IoT system, including applications, business and profit models, and users’ privacy.
- *The processing layer*, also known as the middleware or edge layer, allows for the processing, storage, and analysis of sensor data.

#### Waziup Architecture
Waziup adopts a three-layer architecture, providing a robust framework for IoT applications.

![archi](img/waziup-ecosystem.png)

<!-- WaziDev is a development platform, capable of sending data through LoRaWAN to the WaziGate.
The WaziGate processes locally the data and forwards it to the WaziCloud, were the user applications live.
More on this in Waziup module! -->
- The Perception Layer is embodied by WaziDev, a development platform equipped with sensors to collect and sense environmental information.

- Moving to the Transport Layer, WaziGate takes center stage. It locally processes data received from WaziDev, utilizing LoRaWAN for efficient data transmission to the WaziCloud.

- At the core of the system lies the Application Layer which resides in WaziCloud. This layer hosts user applications, delivering specialized services to end-users and defining the myriad applications in which IoT can be applied.

IoT Technologies
=======================

## Networking & Protocols

Protocols are systems of rules and procedures that allow two or more entities to communicate.
The TCP/IP protocol stack is at the heart of the Internet, which is the “I” in IoT, or course!
It can be represented using the OSI seven-layer reference model.

![OSI](img/OSI.png)

Here are a few protocols used with IoT:
- *HTTP* is the foundation of the client-server model used for the Web. The more secure method to implement HTTP is to include only a client on your IoT device, not a server.
- *WebSocket* is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection between client and server.
- *CoAP* is for use with low-power and constrained networks. CoAP is a RESTful protocol.
- *MQTT* is a publish/subscribe messaging transport that is extremely lightweight and ideal for connecting small devices to constrained networks.


## Radio communications

Radio communications are an essential part of IoT.

Our course on radio communications will introduce the basics of wireless communications: wireless transmission fundamentals, including radio propagation models, antenna technologies, wireless link budget and the relationship between modulation, throughput, energy and transmission range.

## Web & mobile IoT applications

A complete IoT application should always include a web or mobile application.
Our course will show you how to develop a Web interface for your IoT application. At first, we will develop a very simple Web application, based solely on HTML and Javascript. We will build on this knowledge to go to the next step: the Web frameworks. We will show the basics of three of the most popular frameworks: ReactJS, Angular and Vue.

<!-- Data analysis and AI
====================

When people think of AI, most of them think of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI can do everything what humans do (and even better). But the sad truth is, that mankind is not even close to develop a "real AGI". Nowadays AI is very focused on some specific use cases, therefore one can speak of a Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI). Because you train it on a specific thing its capabilities are limited. If you try to use it for another task, it will not perform like you would expect it. AI is separated in many subfields, in this lesson we will elaborate on some of them:

    Machine Learning (ML)
    Deep Leaning (DL)
    Computer Vision (CV)
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) -->


<!-- Business support
